# Cricket Score Predictor Web Application

# Project Overview
The Cricket Score Predictor Web Application is a data-driven application that predicts cricket scores using advanced machine learning techniques. This project showcases skills in data analysis, machine learning, and automation for data collection and model deployment.

# Key Highlights
- Implemented automation for data collection and model deployment in the Cricket Score Predictor Web Application, highlighting automation skills.
- Achieved an outstanding R2 score of 0.98 and a minimal MAE (Mean Absolute Error) of 2.11 by fine-tuning the XGBoost algorithm.

# Automation and Data Collection
One of the notable features of this project is the automation of data collection. I have streamlined the process of gathering cricket-related data, ensuring that the model is always trained on the most up-to-date information. This automation enhances the accuracy of score predictions and minimizes manual data handling.

# Machine Learning Model
The core of the Cricket Score Predictor is its machine learning model, powered by the XGBoost algorithm. Key aspects of the model development include:

**Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming cricket-related data for training and testing.
**Model Tuning**: Fine-tuning hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
**Evaluation Metrics**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as R2 score and MAE.
**Outstanding R2 Score**: Our model has achieved an impressive R2 score of 0.98, indicating its high predictive accuracy.
**Minimal MAE**: The minimal Mean Absolute Error of 2.11 further demonstrates the precision of our score predictions.

# Web Application
The Cricket Score Predictor is accessible via a user-friendly web application built using Streamlit. Users can input relevant match details, and the application provides accurate score predictions based on the trained model.
